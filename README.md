# Challenge 5: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
To create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day. For this application I used the hours from 9am to 5pm.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

I utilized Third Party API's to complete this project.

To use this application, enter your event in the timeblocks colored gray, red-orange or green. To save your event on the scheduler, click on the button with the floppy disk icon. If you reload, your saved events will persist on the page.
